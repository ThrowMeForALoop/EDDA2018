# Question 5.1

pairs(peruvians, upper.panel=NULL)
# Answer: Based on the pairs is possible to see a potential correlation in the following pairs:
# migration x age, migration x weight, migration x wrist
# This conclusion is based on the fact that the plot from these pairs resembles a straight line passing through the
# orign.

# Question 5.2
# Tests will be conducted using Spearma's rank correlation test which doesn't assume normality between the two
# variables.
attach(peruvians) # Keeping the dataset in memory so r functions will access information based on column's
                              # names
# Test 5.2.1 (migration x age)
peruvians[,c(1,2)]
cor.test(migration, age,method="spearman")
# Answer: As can be seen from the test, p-value = 0.0021, which leds us to reject the null hypothesis that rho is equal
# to 0. In fact, the calculated rho based on the samples is 0.4760.

# Test 5.2.2 (migration x weight)
cor.test(migration, weight,method="spearman")
# Answer: As can be seen from the test, p-value = 0.02861, which leds us to reject the null hypothesis that rho is equal
# to 0. In fact, the calculated rho based on the samples is 0.3506.

# Test 5.2.3 (migration x length)
cor.test(migration, length,method="spearman")
# Answer: As can be seen from the test, p-value = 0.6087, which leds us to fail to reject the null hypothesis that rho is equal
# to 0 - considering a o.05 confidence level (despite the fact that R's output states that H0 can be rejected).
# The calculated rho based on the samples is 0.0845 which is very close to 0 -> So it is indeed possible to conclude 
# that these variables are not correlated to each other.

# Test 5.2.4 (migration x wrist)
cor.test(migration, wrist,method="spearman")
# Answer: As can be seen from the test, p-value = 0.1797, which leds us to fail to reject the null hypothesis that rho is equal
# to 0 - considering a o.05 confidence level (despite the fact that R's output states that H0 can be rejected).
# However, the calculated rho for the sample is different from 0 (in fact rho = 0.2193).

# Test 5.2.4 (migration x wrist)
cor.test(migration, wrist,method="spearman")
# Answer: As can be seen from the test, p-value = 0.1797, which leds us to fail to reject the null hypothesis that rho is equal
# to 0 - considering a o.05 confidence level (despite the fact that R's output states that H0 can be rejected).
# However, the calculated rho for the sample is different from 0 (in fact rho = 0.2193).

# Test 5.2.5 (migration x diastolic)
cor.test(migration, diastolic,method="spearman")
# Answer: As can be seen from the test, p-value = 0.6494, which leds us to fail to reject the null hypothesis that rho is equal
# to 0 - considering a o.05 confidence level (despite the fact that R's output states that H0 can be rejected).
# However, the calculated rho for the sample is different from 0 (in fact rho = 0.0751).
